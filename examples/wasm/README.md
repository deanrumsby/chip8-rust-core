# wasm

A very basic example of how the chip8_core library can be used as a WASM module.

## Installation

You will need nodejs installed, then run:
```
npm install
```
followed by 
```
npm start
```

Remember, you will need some Chip8 programs on your local storage to play. 
The key bindings are the same as for the `desktop` example.
