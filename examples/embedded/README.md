# embedded

Since an example application for the embedded environment will be very hardware specific I have chosen not to include 
any toy examples. 

I have created a small embedded application using this library however, using the Raspberry Pi Pico W and a 64 x 32 RGB LED-matrix 
as the display: <https://github.com/deanrumsby/chip8-pico>
