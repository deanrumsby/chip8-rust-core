# basic

A simple application of the interpreter, using SDL2.

To run the example code, you will need to have SDL2 installed on your computer. 
The SDL2 dependency in cargo is only for the Rust bindings that interact with the binary. 

I will convert this example to use the pixels library in the future so that running the example code requires no extra steps.
